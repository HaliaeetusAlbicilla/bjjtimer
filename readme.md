Just a simple timer I need for Brazilian jiu-jitsu training.

Set the sparring time and the break time. Start the timer, and the bell will sound when it's time for a break and again when it's time to roll. The timer will repeat until you stop it. Also the image on top changes to illustrate mat-time and break-time.

I will probably upload this to Google Play
